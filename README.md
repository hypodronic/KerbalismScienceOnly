# KerbalismScienceOnly

A Kerbalism configuration that disables everything Kerablism does, except for the science feature.

## Warning

**This configuration pack isn't maintained and doesn't work with recent (newer than 3.14) Kerbalism versions.**

## Compatibility

This configuration pack allow you to only get the science related features of Kerbalism, all other mechanics (life support, reliability, resource extraction and converters...) will be disabled.
However, there will still be various compatibility issues due to Kerbalism still handling background production/consumption of resources (notably EC), which might conflict with other plugins also attempting to handle them in their own way as well.
A notable example is TAC-LS, for which background life support processing will still be disabled even with this config.
